4.Features

i)User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
Store user data securely in a local database (MongoDB / MySql / PostgreSQL / SQLite).
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with three roles: Admin, Editor, and User.
Admins can manage users and all content.
Editors can create, edit, and delete content but not manage users.
Users can only view content and manage their own profile.
The table should be auto generated whenever server start


ii)File Upload and Management:

Implement file upload functionality allowing users (with appropriate roles) to upload files (e.g., images, PDFs) to the local file system.
Ensure the uploaded files are stored in a secure directory on the local machine.
Implement validation to ensure only allowed file types and sizes are uploaded.
Provide a file management interface where Admins can view and delete uploaded files.

iii)External API Integration:

Integrate with a third-party API (e.g., weather, news, or financial data) to fetch dynamic content.
Display the fetched data in the application, with data updates performed periodically.
Implement error handling for API failures, including retry logic and graceful degradation.

iV)Data Caching:

Implement caching for the external API data to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
Use a local caching solution, such as in-memory caching (e.g., Node.js `lru-cache` package) or storing cached data in a local database.
Ensure the cache is invalidated when the data is stale or when a manual refresh is triggered.
v)Search and Filtering:

Implement a search and filtering feature for the content in the application.
Users should be able to search by keywords and filter by categories or tags.
Implement pagination for search results to efficiently handle large datasets.

vi)Security:

Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse of the login and API endpoints, using local memory for tracking attempts.
Secure sensitive routes with appropriate role-based access control.
Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.

vii)Logging and Monitoring:

Implement local logging to record important events such as user logins, file uploads, and API errors.
Use a logging library like Winston or Morgan to write logs to local files.
Provide a simple monitoring script to check application performance, such as response times or error rates.

viii)Unit and Integration Testing:

Write unit tests for the authentication, file upload, and API integration features.
Write integration tests to ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected.
Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha, with at least 80% code coverage.
